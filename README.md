# Select names rondomly

## Usage
1. create the array(s) of yours in `./js/[any name].js`  
   default js file name is `templete.js`. so you should modify this.  
2. change items of `classNamesForLoading` array in `./js/createName.js`
   e.g.
```
const classNamesForLoading = [
	"[your original 1]",
	"[your original 2]",
	"[your original 3]"
];
```
3. change tags of id in `.classes` in `popup.html`
4. access `chrome://extensions` on Google Chrome  
   you should switch ON of 'developer mode'
5. drag this project file from root(ALL files) and drop into `chrome://extensions` page
