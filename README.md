# Select names rondomly

## Usage

1. create the array(s) of yours in `./js/[any your original name 1].js`  
   default js file name is `templete.js`. so you should modify this.  
2. change items of `classNamesForLoading` array in `./js/createName.js`  
   e.g.
```
const classNamesForLoading = [
	"[any your original name 1]",
	"[any your original name 2]",
	"[any your original name 3]"
];
```
3. change tags of id in `.classes` in `popup.html`  
4. access `chrome://extensions` on Google Chrome    
   you should switch ON of 'developer mode'  
5. drag this project file from root(ALL files) and drop into `chrome://extensions` page  

## Future Prospects

1. I wanna control priority levels of select items  
2. I wanna make configuration **short and simple**
